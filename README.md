### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Katie and I'm recent graduate of Northeastern University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. My focus in college was been on artificial intelligence and software engineering and I am currently looking for a job in a related field.

### I'm Currently Working On...
**Genetic-Disorder-Prediction** uses a dataset of medical history such as blood cell count, heart rate, symptoms, and parental genetic information in order to predict the genetic disorder and disorder subclass. After cleaning and exploring the data, I ran different models with grid search cross validation in order to find the best model. I ended on a MLP model and a Naive Bayes model and achieved an averaged f1 score of .408, compared to a score achieved with random guessing of .198. Then, I decide to explore pytorch neural nets more and was able to achieve an average f1 score of 0.425 using one for each of my target variables. I'm now working on creating a more advanced pytorch neural network model.

### I Recently Finished...
**DS3000-Covid-Project** uses a dataset with COVID information sorted by country such as weekly icu admissions per million, life expectancy in that country, and the number of people fully vaccinated per hundred. With a group of 3 other students, we cleaned and performed EDA on this dataset with the end goal of predicting the total number of deaths per million. We found that the best model was a Random Forest model that achieved a mean squared error of .13. When considering our target variable ranged from about 0 to 10, we were confident we had found an appropriate model.

**capstone_cuda** is my capstone project I completed with 4 other students. We created a guitar attachment that allows the guitar to be strummed and plucked with only one hand. To handle the plucking, a model needed to be created that could determine of which of the strings was being held in order to pluck that string. To accomplish that, we created a dataset of images of the strings being pressed, image preprocessing/augmentation, and finally created a convolutional neural network. The CNN was uploaded on a Raspberry pi board and read in and analyzed live video input of the strings and sent the information to an Arduino board which controlled the hardware portion of plucking the string.
